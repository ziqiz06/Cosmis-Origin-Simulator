    # ── BIG BANG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("bigbang", "icy_moon"): [
        "You do not exist yet — only the energy that will one day condense into the oxygen and hydrogen atoms that form your moon's ice. Space is tearing open everywhere at once, no centre, no edge, just a trillion-degree ocean of quarks and photons setting the first rule of existence: temperature decides everything.",
        "You are a quark in a plasma hotter than any star will ever be, and in a fraction of a second you will become a proton — one step closer to the hydrogen and oxygen that will freeze on your moon's surface billions of years from now. The universe is being born not from a point, but everywhere simultaneously.",
        "Right now you are pure energy, indistinguishable from the rest of the newborn cosmos. The asymmetry that saved matter from antimatter — one extra particle per billion — is the only reason you will one day exist as water on a frozen moon.",
    ],
    ("bigbang", "rocky"): [
        "You are energy — not yet silicon, not yet iron, not yet the bedrock of any world. In the first trillionths of a second, the universe is too hot for matter to last: quarks flicker into existence and annihilate again, and only a razor-thin surplus of matter over antimatter saves the material universe.",
        "The quarks that will one day become your rocky planet's iron core exist right now only as sparks in a trillion-degree plasma. Space is expanding everywhere at once, cooling fast, and the rate of that cooling is the most important fact about your world's future.",
    ],
    ("bigbang", "gas_giant"): [
        "You are energy that will become hydrogen — mostly hydrogen, almost entirely hydrogen, hydrogen forever. In the first microseconds, quarks are flickering into and out of existence, and the expanding universe is already writing your recipe: three parts hydrogen to one part helium, nothing heavier.",
        "The protons that will make up 90% of your gas giant do not yet exist as particles — only as quarks in a trillion-degree plasma. By a margin of one in a billion, matter wins over antimatter, and you survive to become the largest world in your solar system.",
    ],
    ("bigbang", "earth_like"): [
        "You are every element that will ever exist on your world — but right now you are nothing but energy. Space is being created around you, and the first hard rule is being written: the faster the universe cools, the simpler the particles that survive; the slower it cools, the more complex the chemistry that becomes possible.",
        "The carbon that will anchor every living molecule on your future planet does not exist yet — only the energy that will eventually become it. You are in the first instant of a 13.8 billion year journey toward a world that might harbour life.",
    ],
    ("bigbang", "star_system"): [
        "The energy being released right now is all the fuel your star will ever have. In the first fractions of a second, the cosmos is a trillion-degree plasma with no atoms, no chemistry, no structure — only the rate of cooling determines what complex things will ever be possible.",
        "Every photon your star will ever emit begins right here as pure energy, indistinguishable from the rest of the universe. The Big Bang is not an explosion into space — it is the creation of space itself, expanding everywhere at once, and you are in all of it simultaneously.",
    ],

    # ── NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("nucleosynthesis", "icy_moon"): [
        "You are a proton bouncing through the universe's first forge, and in the next three minutes the expansion will decide your fate: fuse into helium, or stay hydrogen forever. Either way, the oxygen you need to become water does not exist yet — that will take a billion years and a dying star.",
        "The universe is a cosmic furnace, but it shuts down after three minutes — the expansion is simply too fast for fusion to reach carbon or oxygen. You are hydrogen, and the molecule of water you will one day become is still impossibly far away.",
    ],
    ("nucleosynthesis", "rocky"): [
        "Three frantic minutes of fusion, then silence. The universe produced hydrogen and helium, and nothing else — the expansion was too fast for the silicon and iron of your future rocky world to form here. You will have to wait for stars.",
        "You are a proton that may or may not fuse into helium in the next three minutes, depending on the exact temperature and timing. Either way, the silicon, iron, and magnesium of your rocky planet cannot form in this primordial forge — the universe cools too fast.",
    ],
    ("nucleosynthesis", "gas_giant"): [
        "In three minutes, the universe pre-loads your gas giant's recipe: 75% hydrogen, 25% helium, locked in by the physics of expansion before anything more complex had a chance to form. You are this mixture, and you always will be.",
        "The cosmic forge runs for exactly three minutes and shuts down. What it produces — hydrogen and helium in a 3:1 ratio — is almost exactly what a gas giant needs. Your world's composition was determined before a single star existed.",
    ],
    ("nucleosynthesis", "earth_like"): [
        "The universe's first forge produces hydrogen and helium and shuts down — the expansion is too fast for any heavier chemistry. Every element your living planet will need is still locked behind a door that only dying stars can open, billions of years from now.",
        "Three minutes, two elements, and then nothing. The carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus that life on your future planet requires cannot form here — the universe is simply expanding too fast. You will have to wait for stars that don't yet exist.",
    ],
    ("nucleosynthesis", "star_system"): [
        "In three minutes, the universe mixes your star's fuel: roughly three parts hydrogen to one part helium, the feedstock for billions of years of nuclear burning. This ratio is not an accident — it is determined precisely by how fast the universe expanded.",
        "The cosmic forge shuts down after three minutes, having produced hydrogen and helium and barely a whisper of lithium. The heavier elements that will build your star system's planets must wait for generations of stars to manufacture them.",
    ],

    # ── FIRST STARS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("first_stars", "icy_moon"): [
        "A hundred million years of darkness, then fire: the first star ignites above you in a cloud of hydrogen gas, and in its core, oxygen is being forged for the first time in cosmic history. That oxygen will eventually bond with hydrogen to form the water that freezes on your moon — but first it has to survive a supernova.",
        "You have been drifting in darkness as a wisp of hydrogen gas for a hundred million years. Now the first stars blaze to life, and in their thermonuclear cores, the oxygen that will one day become your moon's ice is being created for the first time anywhere in the universe.",
    ],
    ("first_stars", "rocky"): [
        "The darkness ends with a star — enormous, short-lived, and blazing at millions of degrees. In its core, silicon and iron are being forged for the first time: the future building blocks of your rocky world, though they will need billions more years and several more stellar deaths to reach you.",
        "The first Population III stars ignite in the darkness, hundreds of times more massive than our sun, and in their cores they forge silicon, magnesium, and iron from scratch. Your rocky planet's ingredients are being produced right now in the universe's first stellar furnaces.",
    ],
    ("first_stars", "gas_giant"): [
        "The first stars burn brilliantly and briefly — they have no heavy elements to help gas clouds cool, so they form enormous, and they live only a few million years. When they die, they scatter the small amounts of silicon and iron that your gas giant's hidden rocky core will eventually need.",
        "Population III stars light up the universe for the first time, and in their brief lives they produce the first heavy elements. You need almost none of them — your gas giant will be mostly primordial hydrogen — but the tiny rocky seed at your centre will be built from their legacy.",
    ],
    ("first_stars", "earth_like"): [
        "The universe's first lights appear — not small, stable stars like your future sun, but enormous, short-lived giants that burn their fuel in a few million years. In their cores, carbon is being created for the first time in cosmic history: the atom that will one day anchor every living molecule on your planet.",
        "A hundred million years of darkness, and then the first fires. These Population III stars live brilliantly and die violently, seeding the cosmos with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for the first time — the chemical foundations of the life that might one day emerge on your world.",
    ],
    ("first_stars", "star_system"): [
        "The first generation of stars lives and dies, each one scattering heavy elements into the cosmos and enriching the next molecular cloud a little more. Your star system is many generations away from forming — but every death happening now is making it slightly more possible.",
        "Population III stars ignite, burn through their hydrogen in a few million years, and die — and each death leaves the cosmos a little richer in carbon, oxygen, and silicon. Your future star system requires several of these cycles before the molecular cloud it forms from will be rich enough.",
    ],

    # ── SUPERNOVA ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("supernova", "icy_moon"): [
        "A massive star collapses in under a second and detonates — and in the shockwave, oxygen is forged and blasted across light-years of space. That oxygen is on its way to you: it will drift through the interstellar medium for millions of years before bonding with hydrogen and freezing on your moon's surface.",
        "In the final millisecond of a dying star's life, every heavy element that ordinary fusion can't produce is forged at once — including the oxygen that will one day become your moon's water. Every molecule of ice on your surface will have passed through a death like this one.",
        "The core collapses, the shockwave propagates, and in the explosion, oxygen and silicon and iron are scattered across light-years. Your moon's ice didn't form in space — it was forged inside a star and blasted outward by its death.",
    ],
    ("supernova", "rocky"): [
        "A star explodes, and silicon, magnesium, and iron are scattered across the void. These atoms will drift for millions of years before being swept up into the collapsing cloud that will form your star — carrying the building blocks of your rocky planet inside them.",
        "Iron core collapse, millisecond implosion, titanic explosion: in that one detonation, every heavy element that requires more energy to build than it releases is forged at once. The silicon and iron of your future planet's mantle and core are being scattered into space right now.",
    ],
    ("supernova", "gas_giant"): [
        "A massive star explodes, and mostly what it contains is hydrogen and helium — your future body. The small fraction of silicon and iron in the shockwave will eventually form the rocky core that triggers your gas giant's runaway hydrogen capture, but your bulk has been prepared since the Big Bang.",
        "The supernova scatters its contents across light-years of space, seeding the next molecular cloud with silicon and iron. Your gas giant will need just enough of these heavy elements to build a rocky core — the rest of you will be the primordial hydrogen that has been waiting since the first three minutes.",
    ],
    ("supernova", "earth_like"): [
        "A star explodes, and in that one catastrophic second, phosphorus — the element that anchors the backbone of DNA — is created and scattered into space. Without this death, and many others like it, the chemistry of life on your planet would be impossible.",
        "The supernova flings carbon, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, and iron across light-years of space. These atoms will drift for millions of years before being swept into the cloud that births your star — carrying every ingredient your living world will need.",
    ],
    ("supernova", "star_system"): [
        "Supernova after supernova enriches the galaxy, and each explosion makes the next molecular cloud a little richer in heavy elements. Your star system is being prepared, one stellar death at a time — it will take dozens of these explosions before the cloud is ready.",
        "A nearby star detonates, and the shockwave compresses the molecular cloud that will eventually collapse into your star system. The explosion is not just destructive — it is the trigger that will, in a few million years, set everything in motion.",
    ],

    # ── GALAXY FORMATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("galaxies", "icy_moon"): [
        "You are drifting through the forming Milky Way — a wisp of oxygen and hydrogen that will one day bond into water on an icy moon. Dark matter halos are pulling the galaxy together around you, and inside its spiral arms, stellar nurseries are building up the heavy-element reserves your moon's birthplace will need.",
        "Generations of stars have lived and died in the galaxy around you, each one leaving the cosmos a little richer in oxygen. The galaxy is slowly assembling the chemistry needed for water-bearing worlds — and you are one of the oxygen atoms that will end up frozen on one of them.",
    ],
    ("galaxies", "rocky"): [
        "You are drifting through the forming spiral arms of the Milky Way, an atom of silicon that has already passed through one stellar core and one supernova. Around you, more stars are being born, living, and dying — each cycle enriching the galaxy a little more with the elements your rocky world will need.",
        "The Milky Way is assembling itself, and inside it, each stellar generation leaves behind a richer interstellar medium. Your rocky planet's ingredients are accumulating slowly — silicon, iron, magnesium — atom by atom, supernova by supernova.",
    ],
    ("galaxies", "gas_giant"): [
        "The galaxy is forming, and out in its cold, hydrogen-rich outer reaches — where gas giants live — molecular clouds are accumulating the small amounts of heavy elements needed to build a rocky core. Your gas giant is mostly primordial hydrogen, but without these trace elements, it could never form.",
        "Dark matter halos pull the Milky Way together, and inside its spiral arms, multiple generations of stars are cycling through — each one making the next cloud slightly richer in silicon and iron. You need only a little of both to build your gas giant's core, but even that required billions of years of stellar recycling.",
    ],
    ("galaxies", "earth_like"): [
        "Four or five stellar generations have already lived and died in the galaxy around you. Each death enriched the cosmos a little more, adding the carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus that a habitable world requires. The galaxy is only now becoming chemically mature enough to produce a planet like yours.",
        "You are drifting through a galaxy that is still assembling itself — a carbon atom that has already been inside two stars and scattered by one supernova. The Milky Way's spiral arms are becoming richer with every passing generation, and the molecular cloud that will birth your star is still accumulating mass.",
    ],
    ("galaxies", "star_system"): [
        "The Milky Way takes shape around you — spiral arms, stellar nurseries, dark matter halos — and inside it, the multi-generational process of heavy element enrichment is steadily continuing. Your star system is generations away from forming, but every death happening now is making it possible.",
        "Stellar generation after stellar generation enriches the interstellar medium, and the molecular cloud that will one day collapse into your star system is slowly accumulating. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding; dying stars provide the chemistry.",
    ],

    # ── NEBULA ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("nebula", "icy_moon"): [
        "A shockwave from a dying star compresses your molecular cloud, and as it collapses and spins into a disk, the temperature drops sharply with distance from the newborn star. Out where you are forming — beyond the frost line — water ice is condensing onto dust grains for the first time in this solar system.",
        "The cloud collapses, angular momentum spins it flat, and a protostar ignites at the center. Beyond three AU, where you are gathering, the temperature is cold enough for water ice to be solid — and grain by grain, your future moon's body is beginning to assemble from the frozen debris of a billion years of stellar chemistry.",
        "A dying star's final gift is this shockwave that collapses the cloud into your future solar system. Out in the cold outer disk, far from the new star's heat, ices are condensing onto every dust grain — and you are accumulating from these icy fragments, growing slowly toward the frozen world you will become.",
    ],
    ("nebula", "rocky"): [
        "The collapsing cloud spins into a disk, and inside the frost line — where the young star's heat keeps ice from forming — only silicates and iron dust survive. You are forming here, in the hot inner zone, sweeping up rock-forming minerals that will become your mantle, your crust, your core.",
        "A protostar ignites at the center of the spinning disk, and its heat draws a line: inside the frost line, only rock; outside, ice and gas. You are in the rocky inner zone, assembling from silicate and iron grains that will differentiate into layers when the heat of accretion melts you.",
    ],
    ("nebula", "gas_giant"): [
        "The cloud collapses into a disk, and beyond the frost line — your territory — water ice condenses onto dust grains, more than doubling the solid material available for planet building. This is the moment your gas giant becomes possible: without the frost line, there wouldn't be enough solid material to build the massive core you need to capture gas.",
        "Beyond three AU, where you are forming, icy grains are abundant and solid material is plentiful. You are assembling a rocky core fast, racing against the clock — if the stellar wind disperses the disk before your core reaches critical mass, you will never capture the hydrogen envelope that makes you a gas giant.",
    ],
    ("nebula", "earth_like"): [
        "The nebula collapses and the new star ignites, casting its heat outward across the disk. You are forming at one AU — close enough to be warm, far enough to keep water from boiling away. The habitable zone where you are assembling is narrow, and your position in it is the most important fact about your future.",
        "The disk forms around the young star, and temperature dictates everything: inside your orbit it's too hot for water ice, outside it's too cold for liquid water. You are in the sweet spot — the Goldilocks zone — but whether you stay there for long enough depends on every choice that follows.",
    ],
    ("nebula", "star_system"): [
        "The collapsing cloud spins into a disk spanning billions of kilometers, and the young star's heat draws the frost line at roughly three AU. Rocky planets will form inside that line, icy worlds and gas giants outside it — the entire architecture of your star system is being decided right now by temperature alone.",
        "A molecular cloud collapses inward, spinning faster and faster until it flattens into a disk. The protostar igniting at the center is already sorting the disk by temperature: silicates and iron fall close in, ice and hydrogen pool further out. Your star system's blueprint is being written.",
    ],

    # ── ACCRETION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("accretion", "icy_moon"): [
        "Icy dust grains are colliding and sticking in the cold outer disk — pebbles, then boulders, then a growing moon. The gas giant you orbit is already pulling at you gravitationally, and that same tidal kneading that shapes your orbit will one day heat your interior enough to keep an ocean liquid beneath your ice.",
        "You are accumulating — collision by collision, grain by grain — from the icy debris of the outer disk. Your mass is small, but your orbit is close enough to a growing gas giant that tidal forces are already flexing you, generating the heat that will persist for billions of years inside your frozen shell.",
        "Your moon is growing from the debris of the outer solar system, sweeping up ice and rock in a runaway accretion that takes only a million years. The gas giant you orbit is a gravitational anchor and a heat source both — and the ocean it will eventually warm inside you is already being prepared.",
    ],
    ("accretion", "rocky"): [
        "Dust becomes pebbles, pebbles become boulders, and boulders sweep up everything around them in a runaway cascade. The energy of the collisions melts you — iron sinks to your core, silicates rise to your mantle — and in that liquid iron core, your future magnetic field is beginning to stir.",
        "You are growing at your orbital distance, sweeping up planetesimals and melting from the heat of constant collision. Differentiation is happening inside you right now: iron falling inward to form a core, lighter silicates rising — and whether your world generates a magnetic field depends on how large that iron core grows.",
    ],
    ("accretion", "gas_giant"): [
        "Your rocky core has just crossed ten Earth masses — and now runaway gas accretion begins. Hydrogen and helium pour inward from the disk faster than the disk can replenish, and in less than a million years you will grow from a rocky seed into a world three hundred times the mass of Earth.",
        "The rocky core threshold is crossed and gas floods in — you are becoming a gas giant in geological fast-forward. The disk's hydrogen and helium rush toward your growing gravity well, and the runaway process that is happening right now will make you the dominant gravitational force in your entire solar system.",
    ],
    ("accretion", "earth_like"): [
        "You are sweeping up silicate and iron-rich debris in a runaway feedback loop — each collision melts you a little more, iron differentiates downward into your core, and in that liquid iron heart, a magnetic dynamo is beginning to form. Whether that dynamo survives will determine whether your atmosphere survives.",
        "Collision after collision remelts you and reshapes you: iron falling to your core, lighter silicates rising to your mantle, differentiation carving you into layers. The molten iron at your centre is the most important thing about you right now — it will generate the magnetic field that may one day protect everything living on your surface.",
    ],
    ("accretion", "star_system"): [
        "Planets are forming simultaneously across the disk — rocky worlds in the inner zone, gas giants racing to capture hydrogen in the outer zone before the stellar wind disperses the disk. The architecture of your star system is being locked in right now, in a few million chaotic years of runaway growth and giant impacts.",
        "The disk is a construction site: multiple worlds assembling at once, sweeping up material, colliding and merging. The final orbital configuration that emerges from this chaos will determine whether any of these worlds ends up in a stable position — and stability, over geological time, is the hidden prerequisite for life.",
    ],

    # ── EVOLUTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ("evolution", "icy_moon"): [
        "You orbit your gas giant in an endless tidal embrace — every orbit squeezes and stretches your interior, generating heat through friction deep in your rock and ice. Beneath kilometers of frozen shell, a saltwater ocean has been liquid for a billion years, and near its hydrothermal vents, the chemistry of life is being tested against geological time.",
        "The tidal kneading never stops — your gas giant's gravity flexes you with every orbit, converting orbital energy into interior heat, keeping your ocean from freezing solid. In that dark, warm water beneath your ice shell, mineral-rich hydrothermal vents are producing the same chemical gradients that Earth's early ocean once did.",
        "Your ice shell is cracking and reforming on geological timescales as tidal forces churn your interior. Beneath it, a global ocean has persisted for over a billion years — warmed from below by tidal friction, shielded from radiation by your gas giant's magnetic field. Whether life has stirred in that ocean is the question.",
    ],
    ("evolution", "rocky"): [
        "Your magma ocean has cooled to basalt, and now volcanoes are building your first atmosphere from outgassed carbon dioxide and water vapor. Whether that atmosphere survives the next billion years depends on one thing: whether your liquid iron core generates a magnetic field strong enough to hold back the stellar wind.",
        "The surface has cooled, a crust has formed, and your primitive atmosphere is growing from volcanic outgassing. You sit at the edge of habitability — warm enough for water to be liquid if your atmosphere is thick enough, but the stellar wind is always pushing back, and only your magnetic field stands between you and a barren future like Mars.",
    ],
    ("evolution", "gas_giant"): [
        "You are a swirling colossus of hydrogen and helium, generating more heat from gravitational contraction than you receive from your star. Your magnetic field stretches across millions of kilometres, shielding your moons from radiation — and in the tidal forces you exert on those moons, at least one of them may be hosting a warm hidden ocean right now.",
        "You will never have a solid surface, never have liquid water, never be a candidate for life yourself. But your gravity is reshaping everything around you — deflecting comets from the inner planets, heating your moons from the inside out, setting orbital resonances that will persist for billions of years. The story of your system's habitability runs through you.",
    ],
    ("evolution", "earth_like"): [
        "Plate tectonics has begun, and with it a feedback loop that will regulate your climate for billions of years: volcanism releases carbon dioxide, weathering removes it, and the ocean absorbs the rest. Your magnetic field holds back the stellar wind, liquid water covers most of your surface, and active geology keeps the carbon cycle running. All three conditions are aligned — and that alignment took 13.8 billion years to achieve.",
        "Your world has everything a habitable planet needs — but none of it was guaranteed. The liquid water, the magnetic shield, the thick atmosphere, the plate tectonics: each one depended on choices made billions of years ago, from the supernova that seeded your system to the mass you accumulated during accretion. You are the improbable result of all of them working together.",
    ],
    ("evolution", "star_system"): [
        "The planets have settled into stable orbits, the late heavy bombardment has tapered off, and in your system's habitable zone, at least one world has liquid water on its surface. Whether that world can sustain those conditions for the billions of years life requires is the question your star system is now quietly answering.",
        "Your star system has reached a kind of equilibrium — rocky worlds in the inner zone, gas giants in the outer zone, a moderate impact rate delivering water and organics to the habitable worlds. Whether any of these worlds will remain stable long enough for life to take hold is the ultimate test of everything that happened in the previous 9 billion years.",
